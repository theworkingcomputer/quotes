<blockquote class="western">Dear Thom:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">We had your letter this morning. I will
answer it from my point of view and of course Elaine will from hers.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">First — if you are in love — that’s
a good thing — that’s about the best thing that can happen to
anyone. Don’t let anyone make it small or light to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">Second — There are several kinds of
love. One is a selfish, mean, grasping, egotistical thing which uses
love for self-importance. This is the ugly and crippling kind. The
other is an outpouring of everything good in you — of kindness and
consideration and respect — not only the social respect of manners
but the greater respect which is recognition of another person as
unique and valuable. The first kind can make you sick and small and
weak but the second can release in you strength, and courage and
goodness and even wisdom you didn’t know you had.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">You say this is not puppy love. If you
feel so deeply — of course it isn’t puppy love.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">But I don’t think you were asking me
what you feel. You know better than anyone. What you wanted me to
help you with is what to do about it — and that I can tell you.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">Glory in it for one thing and be very
glad and grateful for it.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">The object of love is the best and most
beautiful. Try to live up to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">If you love someone — there is no
possible harm in saying so — only you must remember that some
people are very shy and sometimes the saying must take that shyness
into consideration.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">Girls have a way of knowing or feeling
what you feel, but they usually like to hear it also.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">It sometimes happens that what you feel
is not returned for one reason or another — but that does not make
your feeling less valuable and good.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">Lastly, I know your feeling because I
have it and I’m glad you have it.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">We will be glad to meet Susan. She will
be very welcome. But Elaine will make all such arrangements because
that is her province and she will be very glad to. She knows about
love too and maybe she can give you more help than I can.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">And don’t worry about losing. If it is
right, it happens — The main thing is not to hurry. Nothing good
gets away.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="western">Love,</blockquote>
