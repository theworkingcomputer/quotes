<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in">But, like all
enlightening experiences, I can't really tell you about it because
you had to be me, there, experiencing it and you aren't and you
weren't. I saw that I couldn't really explain what had happened to me
because I had only just begun to draw lines between all the dots of
information and experience that I had had in my life and, although it
was clear to me at the time, a picture that I could share with others
was impossible. All you can do is try to draw one or two of the lines
between two or three of the dots that you know you have in common
with somebody, (although with songwriters it's anybody who'll
listen), and hope that that person can see the connection that you're
trying to make. Not everyone will get it, and if they do, it's with
their dots, not yours although we all come with the Human Kit and so
lots of those dots are similar, which is why we can communicate at
all.  --John “McDuke” Dawson</p>

of course, the people don't want war.</b> Why would some poor slob on
a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get
out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece. <b>Naturally, the
common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in
America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood.</b> But,
after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy
and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it
is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a
Communist dictatorship.<br/>
<i>Gilbert</i>: There is one difference.
In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their
elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can
declare wars.<br/>
<i>Göring</i>: Oh, that is all well and good,
but, voice or no voice, <b>the people can always be brought to the
bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them
they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of
patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way
in any country.</b></p>

<p class="western" style="border: none; padding: 0in">It would be
great if the world was a perfectly calibrated machine, into the top
of which we poured talent and hard work, and out dropped the matching
level of success. But it’s not. Just because something is good, or
someone is talented, doesn’t automatically mean it‘ll succeed.
Just because it’s bad, it won’t necessarily fail. This is why
Paris Hilton has a bigger house than you, why Wyclef Jean is still
making music and why David Hasselhoff can restart his career by
getting drunk and eating a burger off the floor.</p>

<p class="western" align="left">Marketing is how you recalibrate that
broken machine to give you the attention and success you deserve.
Knowing how you’re going to publicise the thing you’re doing is
just as important as the actual thing you are doing. For every minute
you spend building it, for every dollar you spend building it, you
need to do the same marketing it.</p>
